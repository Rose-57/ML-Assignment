Project Overview

This project aims to predict housing prices in California by applying various regression models. The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which contains information like the median income, age of the house, and the number of rooms. The target variable is the median house value.

We have implemented and evaluated several regression models, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)


Each model is assessed using key performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²), which allows us to compare their performance and determine the best model for this dataset.

The project demonstrates the process of training, evaluating, and comparing different regression models using Python's scikit-learn library, showcasing how machine learning algorithms can be applied to predict real-world data, such as housing prices.
